/**
 *  <p>This session provides methods for retrieving <code> Term </code>
 *  objects. The <code> Term </code> represents a time period in which courses
 *  are offered. </p>.
 *
 *  <p> This session defines views that offer differing behaviors when
 *  retrieving multiple objects. </p>
 *
 *  <p>
 *  <ul>
 *      <li> comparative view: elements may be silently omitted or re-ordered
 *      </li>
 *      <li> plenary view: provides a complete set or is an error condition
 *      </li>
 *      <li> isolated course catalog view: All term methods in this session
 *      operate, retrieve and pertain to terms defined explicitly in the
 *      current course catalog. Using an isolated view is useful for managing
 *      <code> Terms </code> with the <code> TermAdminSession. </code> </li>
 *      <li> federated course catalog view: All term methods in this session
 *      operate, retrieve and pertain to all terms defined in this course
 *      catalog and any other terms implicitly available in this course
 *      catalog through course catalog inheritence. </li>
 *  </ul>
 *  Generally, the comparative view should be used for most applications as it
 *  permits operation even if there is data that cannot be accessed. The
 *  methods <code> useFederatedCourseCatalogView() </code> and <code>
 *  useIsolatedCourseCatalogView() </code> behave as a radio group and one
 *  should be selected before invoking any lookup methods. </p>
